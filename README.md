## Code requirements:<br>
### The game uses both continuous and discrete inputs from the player:<br>
When the player drags the ball and drags it in the air, there is continuous inputs. When the player releases the ball, the ball will either fall down because of gravity or fly through the air.

### The playerâ€™s goal can only be achieved indirectly (by allowing the physics engine to move key objects into position/contact). <br>
In order to make a basket, the player must have let go of the ball and the ball must go into the hole.

### 3+ physics-based gameplay scenes (possibly implemented with a single Phaser Scene subclass).<br>
1. Level1 (the first and easiest level in the game)
2. Level2 (the second level in the game)
3. Level3 (the last and hardest level in the game)

### Other scenes are used to separate and contextualize the gameplay scenes<br>
I have intro and outro scenes to signify that the game is starting or ending respectively. There are summary screens to show how long the player took to finish the level. <br><br>

## Asset and code sources:<br> 
I drew all my images with this [free online website](https://sketchpad.app/en/). All code is my own.
